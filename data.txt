CMRU Logo

Swan Taking Flight

The CMR University logo is inspired by that of the CMR Jnanadhara Trust, the University’s promoting body. The logo depicts a beautiful swan that is just about to take off from the waters, one that is reaching for the skies.

The swan is the carrier of Goddess Saraswathi – the Goddess of Learning.

It is said that the Swan with its sensitive beak has the power of discrimination – an ability to distinguish pure milk from a mixture of milk and water. The swan thus symbolizes discrimination between right and wrong, good and evil or the eternal and the transient. It is this ability to acquire and apply knowledge in a discerning manner, for the overall good of mankind, which closely aligns with the University’s ethos.

Rooted in Indian tradition, this contemporary form of the Hamsa, the Swan wholly embodies the vision of CMR University.

Innovation Centre & Design Thinking Lab
The Innovation Centre & Design Thinking Lab (Innovation Centre & Design Thinking Lab) at CMRU Lakeside Campus, is a dynamic and inclusive space designed to spark creativity and catalyze innovation. It is a collaborative environment intended to foster an experimental culture on campus by promoting interdisciplinary and cross-stream engagement among students. The lab has thoughtfully crafted a supportive and stimulating environment where students can collaborate, conceive, and create products, services, or experiences benefiting society and encouraging innovation and solving current and future challenges.

This helps students develop essential and new-age skills. These include empathizing, ideating, problem-solving, creativity, and communication skills. By working through the design thinking process, students learn to identify problems, generate ideas, prototype solutions, and iterate based on user feedback. They also learn how to communicate their ideas effectively both verbally and visually, which is crucial for success in any field. These learnings help in the overall growth of students and create Change-makers instead of Change-seekers.

The Innovation Centre & Design Thinking Lab is also a valuable resource addition for faculty and staff at CMRU Lakeside Campus. It provides them with access to a space where they can experiment with new teaching methods and develop innovative approaches to research and problem-solving. The ambiance and setup of the lab is such that it also supports informal/interdisciplinary collaboration among faculty, enabling them to work together on research projects, brainstorm, and introduce new pedagogies that benefit students across the university.

The lab is equipped with a range of spaces and tools to support the innovation process. Here are some of the key features:

Presentation Space

The Presentation Space is the perfect place for teams to share their ideas with others. Equipped with a large screen and state-of-the-art sound system, this space has been designed to help speakers communicate their ideas effectively and engage their audience. The seating is comfortable and arranged to create an informal atmosphere, promoting interaction and discussion.

Mini Presentation Area
The Mini Presentation Area is a perfect setting for students to showcase their projects to a smaller audience, enabling them to receive quick feedback and refine their ideas. It is an ideal space for our students to test their concepts and prototypes in a more intimate setting and engage with their peers in a constructive and supportive environment.

Brainstorming Area
The Brainstorming Area features different sizes and shapes of whiteboards, soft boards, and writing surfaces such as glass top tables, that enable students to collaborate effectively and visually map out their ideas. We believe that collaboration and teamwork are essential in inspiring innovation, and this area has been designed to facilitate the exchange of ideas and foster a sense of community among our students. To further enhance the brainstorming experience the place has a relaxing and inspiring atmosphere with comfortable seating and natural lighting.

Prototyping Space
The Prototyping Space is dedicated to supporting the prototyping process, providing teams with the tools and equipment they need to turn their ideas into tangible prototypes. The prototyping area will be equipped with a wide range of cutting-edge tools and equipment such as 3D printers, development boards, electronics consumables etc. The goal with this space is to provide CMRU students with access to the latest prototyping technologies, enabling them to bring their ideas to life in innovative and exciting ways.

Collaboration between students from diverse academic fields is one of the standout features of the Innovation Centre & Design Thinking Lab. Here, engineering, design, business and humanities converge towards working on real-world problems together. The resulting cross-fertilization of ideas allows for a more profound understanding of contemporary challenges facing society. Alongside this comes an emphasis on nurturing innovation through a structured process that spans ideation to prototyping then testing and finally iteration. The Innovation Centre & Design Thinking Lab creates a secure and nurturing setting where students can nurture their ideas and fine-tune their solutions through constructive feedback from faculties, mentors and peers.

The prototyping zone allows students to think and tinker their solutions
